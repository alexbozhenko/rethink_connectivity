# Outline

## Title

Micro-services reimagined

## Thesis

We're told we need a dozen different technologies to get a microservices architecture up and running, but what if you could do nearly everything with a single technology, and a much, much simpler set of tools?

## Intro

[TBD: Talk about how we got to where we are, and why the monolith vs microservice debate is happening, and why nobody has truly verbalized the true problem]

## The 1:1 Problem

## Location Transparency

No longer about "Who do I talk to?", but more "What do I want to talk about?".
